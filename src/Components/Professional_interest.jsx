    <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-green-700">Cybersecurity</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently focused on <strong>bug bounty hunting</strong> and <strong>web penetration testing</strong>, 
      learning and sharpening my skills through <strong>Capture The Flag</strong> challenges from platforms such as 
      <a href="https://www.hacker101.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-green-600 hover:underline"> Hacker101</a> 
      and 
      <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-green-600 hover:underline"> TryHackMe</a>. 
      These resources help me simulate real-world vulnerabilities and practice the techniques needed for effective security testing.

    <p>
      I am passionate about trading, and I am currently practicing <strong>cryptocurrency trading</strong> to understand market trends and 
      develop strategies. In the future, I also aim to dive into the <strong>Forex market</strong> to expand my knowledge and 
      diversify my trading experience across different asset classes.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-green-700">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      A recent university subject sparked my interest in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> after realizing the 
      vast number of applications it could have in fields I’m already passionate about — such as <strong>cybersecurity</strong> 
      and <strong>trading</strong>. I am now exploring how AI can be integrated to enhance security analysis, detect threats, 
      and optimize trading strategies.
